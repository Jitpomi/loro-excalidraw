# Loro Excalidraw Example

- This demo serves as a proof of concept for the Loro Excalidraw integration. It's not optimized for production use.
- Play online at https://loro-excalidraw.vercel.app/
- This demo simulates syncing via BroadcastChannel. You can open several tabs to simulate multiplayer. 
  - Currently, if you open a new tab after editing, the new tab won't get the old updates from the others
